# Classification
It can simply be defined as a machine learning technique to identify the category of new observations based on training data unlike regression that predict continuous number

---

## Explanation
_Unlike regression where you predict a continuous number, you use classification to predict a category. There is a wide variety of classification applications from medicine to marketing. Classification models include linear models like Logistic Regression, SVM, and nonlinear ones like K-NN, Kernel SVM and Random Forests._

> Classification is a supervised machine learning technique used to categorize data into predefined classes or groups. The goal of classification is to predict the category or class label of new data points based on patterns learned from labeled training data.

## Examples of Classification Models
> Machine Learning Classification models:
> +Logistic Regression
> + K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)
> + Support Vector Machine (SVM)
> + Kernel SVM
> + Naive Bayes
> + Decision Tree Classification
> + Random Forest Classification

## Practical Problems dealt with Classification
> __Examples of Classification Problems:__
> + Spam Detection: Classifying emails as "spam" or "not spam."
> + Disease Diagnosis: Determining if a patient has a specific disease based on medical data.
> + Image Recognition: Identifying objects or animals in images, such as "cat" or "dog."
> + Customer Segmentation: Categorizing customers into groups based on purchasing behavior.

> Classification is widely used in applications like fraud detection, recommendation systems, and predictive analytics, making it a cornerstone of machine learning.

## Continuous number Vs Category
### Continuous Number
> Continuous numbers represent data that can take any value within a specified range. They are numeric and can include fractions or decimals. These values are measured rather than counted and typically represent quantities.

#### Examples:
+ Height (e.g., 5.8 feet)
+ Weight (e.g., 72.3 kg)
+ Temperature (e.g., 98.6°F)
+ Age (e.g., 25.5 years)

### Category (Categorical Data)
> Categorical data represents discrete labels, names, or categories that classify data into specific groups. These values are qualitative and do not have a natural order (for nominal data) or are ranked (for ordinal data).

#### Examples:
__Nominal Data:__
+ Gender: Male, Female, Other
+ Colors: Red, Blue, Green
+ Car Brands: Toyota, Ford, Tesla

__Ordinal Data (has a natural order):__
+ Education Level: High School, Bachelor’s, Master’s, Ph.D.
+ Rating: Poor, Average, Good, Excellent
